# Deployment Plan

## Railway Deployment
- [ ] Create a custom Dockerfile for Railway deployment that installs required build dependencies (including python3-distutils and build-essential).
- [ ] Update the Dockerfile to use a stable Node.js version (e.g., node:20-slim) to compile native modules properly.
- [ ] Test the Docker build locally to ensure that `isolated-vm` compiles without errors.
- [ ] Configure Railway to use the custom Dockerfile for deployment.
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs and verify production readiness.

## Notes
- The issue with `isolated-vm` is due to Python's missing distutils module, resolved by installing python3-distutils.
- Using Railway allows us to utilize a custom Docker container, providing control over system dependencies required for native module compilation.
