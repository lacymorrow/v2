# Vite Templates

## Overview

The project uses two Vite template directories for different purposes:

1. `/templates/vite/` - Source template
2. `/vite-project/` - Pre-built template with cached dependencies

## Template Purposes

### Source Template (`/templates/vite/`)
- Acts as the source of truth for the template structure
- Contains the base configuration and structure for new Vite projects
- Used as a reference for template updates and modifications
- Maintains a clean, dependency-free version of the template

### Pre-built Template (`/vite-project/`)
- Contains a fully installed `node_modules` directory
- Used as a performance optimization for the app generation process
- Serves as the `TEMPLATE_PATH` in the app generator
- Provides cached dependencies via `CACHED_MODULES_PATH`

## How They Work Together

The app generation process (`src/server/services/app-generator.ts`) uses these templates efficiently:

1. Copies template files from `vite-project` (excluding `node_modules` and other unnecessary files)
2. If cached `node_modules` exists in `vite-project`:
   - Copies the cached modules
   - Performs a quick install to ensure correct linking
3. If no cached modules exist:
   - Performs a full dependency installation

## Benefits

This two-template approach provides several advantages:
1. **Faster App Generation**: Reuses pre-built dependencies
2. **Clean Reference**: Maintains a clean template source
3. **Optimized Builds**: Utilizes cached node_modules
4. **Clear Separation**: Separates source from build artifacts

## Important Note

⚠️ **DO NOT DELETE** either template directory as they serve different but complementary purposes in the app generation process.
