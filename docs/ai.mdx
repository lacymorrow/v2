# AI-Powered React App Generator

## Overview
Building a service that generates React applications from natural language prompts, similar to bolt.new or vzero. The system will use AI to interpret prompts and generate complete React applications with proper dependencies.

## Core Features
- [ ] AI prompt interpretation system
- [ ] React application generator
- [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Isolated app environments
- [ ] Public URL generation
- [ ] Development server management

## Technical Architecture

### Phase 1: Basic React Generator
- [ ] Create prompt interpretation service
- [ ] Set up Vite-based React template system ([see templates documentation](./templates.mdx))
- [ ] Implement basic file generation
- [ ] Create sandbox environment for generated apps
- [ ] Set up public URL routing system

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add dependency detection and management
- [ ] Implement real-time preview system
- [ ] Add support for different React templates
- [ ] Create caching system for generated apps
- [ ] Add Next.js template support

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Core Infrastructure
1. [ ] Create base API endpoint for app generation
2. [ ] Set up Vite configuration generator
3. [ ] Implement file storage system
4. [ ] Create URL generation service

### Step 2: AI Integration
1. [ ] Create prompt analysis system
2. [ ] Implement code generation pipeline
3. [ ] Add dependency detection
4. [ ] Create template selection logic

### Step 3: Development Environment
1. [ ] Set up isolated container system
2. [ ] Implement build process
3. [ ] Create development server manager
4. [ ] Add real-time preview capability

## Current Status
Starting implementation of core infrastructure.
