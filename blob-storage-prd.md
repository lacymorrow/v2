# Blob Storage Integration for WebContainer - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and implementation plan for integrating Vercel Blob Storage with the WebContainer component in our application generation platform. This integration will enable persistent storage of generated applications to provide a reliable preview experience.

## Problem Statement

The current implementation has several limitations:
1. App files aren't automatically persisted to Blob Storage in production
2. There's no clear handoff between app generation and blob storage upload
3. Users experience broken previews in production when generated files aren't properly stored

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Persistence**: Ensure all generated app files are reliably stored in Vercel Blob Storage
2. **Performance**: Maintain fast app generation and preview experience 
3. **Reliability**: Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize storage operations to minimize costs

## User Experience

1. User initiates app generation
2. App is generated and files are stored in local filesystem (temporarily)
3. Files are uploaded to Blob Storage in the background
4. WebContainer preview loads files from Blob Storage URLs
5. Public-facing previews use Blob Storage URLs directly

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Blob Storage Service Enhancements

- Extend `BlobStorage` class to support WebContainer integration
- Add methods for retrieving file URLs from Blob Storage
- Implement efficient batch operations for uploads
- Add specialized error handling for WebContainer-specific scenarios

### 2. WebContainer Integration

- Modify WebContainer initialization to load files from Blob Storage URLs
- Implement fallback to local file system when needed
- Add diagnostics for blob storage issues

### 3. App Generation Flow Updates

- Update app generator to use a two-phase approach:
  1. Generate files to temporary filesystem
  2. Upload completed files to Blob Storage as a batch
- Ensure proper handoff between generation and preview phases

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

- Add comprehensive logging for Blob Storage operations
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- Create recovery paths for interrupted uploads
- Add diagnostics panel for debugging storage issues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1-2)

1. Extend BlobStorage service with WebContainer-specific methods
2. Update app generator to properly upload to Blob Storage after generation
3. Modify WebContainer component to load from Blob Storage URLs

### Phase 2: Reliability and UX Improvements (Week 3-4)

1. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
2. Add diagnostics for blob storage issues
3. Improve logging and diagnostics

### Phase 3: Optimization and Testing (Week 5-6)

1. Optimize storage operations for performance and cost
2. Implement batch operations where possible
3. Comprehensive testing across different scenarios
4. Documentation updates

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - BlobStorage service extensions
   - WebContainer integration points
   - Error handling mechanisms

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end flow from generation to preview
   - Recovery from network interruptions

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Upload performance for varying app sizes
   - Load time impact with Blob Storage integration
   - Bandwidth usage analysis

4. **Production Validation**:
   - A/B testing with sample of users
   - Monitoring of error rates and performance metrics

## Success Metrics

1. **Reliability**: >99.9% success rate for file storage operations
2. **Performance**: <5% increase in overall generation and preview load time
3. **User Experience**: No perceived difference in preview responsiveness
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Optimization of storage operations to minimize API calls

## Dependencies

1. Vercel Blob Storage API and SDK
2. WebContainer API access to storage mechanisms
3. App generator service modifications

## Rollout Plan

1. Development environment testing (Week 1-2)
2. Internal team testing (Week 3)
3. Limited production rollout (Week 4)
4. Full production release (Week 5-6)

## Future Considerations

1. **Versioning**: Support for file versions to enable rollbacks
2. **Diff Management**: Track and store only file differences to optimize storage
3. **Save Functionality**: Add ability for users to save changes made in WebContainer (if needed in the future)
